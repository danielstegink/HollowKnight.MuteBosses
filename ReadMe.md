# Mute Bosses
This mod silences bosses in Hollow Knight.

You can customize which bosses the mod silences via the 
menu (and yes, there is a simple button to toggle them all
on/off). And as a bonus, this mod can be used to silence 
Zote.

This mod isn't guaranteed to silence minions, but it 
should silence attacks, roars and other dramatic sounds. 
To silence enemies with explosive deaths, such as the 
Traitor Lord, toggle InfectionDeathExplosion.
